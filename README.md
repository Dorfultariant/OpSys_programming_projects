#### Projects that were done

Reverse, a simple program that can reverse input, when I made it I had just learned about linked lists.

Unix Utilities, four small programs, cat, grep, zip and unzip.

Kernel Hacking, in which I added a syscall "getreadcount" with the option to reset the counter. Kernel used was xv6 (x86) available at github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public
